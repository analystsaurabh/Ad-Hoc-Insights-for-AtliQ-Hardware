# Ad-Hoc-Insights-for-AtliQ-Hardware

In this project, I analyzed AtliQ hardware’s data and uncovered patterns that led to meaningful insights.

## 🎯 Problem Statement 🎯

AtliQ Hardware, one of the leading computer hardware manufacturers relied on Excel for managing business operations. As the company grew, so did its data.
This led to:
- 📉 Inefficiency: Excel became slow and difficult to manage with large datasets.
- 🚫 Limited Scalability: The growing business needed a more robust data management solution.
- 🔍 Lack of Data Insights: Business decisions were based on fragmented data instead of a unified source.

To transition into a data-driven company, AtliQ Hardware decided to move to a scalable SQL-based database. To manage the growing business, their senior data analyst, Tony Sharma created an SQL challenge to test and recruit talent who can assist him at AtliQ hardware.

## 🛠️ tools I Used 🛠️
- MySQL for querying results
- Power BI for data visualization
- Figma for graphic design
- Clipchamp for video editing

## 💡 Learnings 💡
- ✅ SQL Mastery: Applied subqueries, operators, CTEs, functions, and stored procedures to solve real business problems in MySQL.
- ✅ Data Visualization: Transformed raw insights into clear, impactful visuals using Power BI.
- ✅ Storytelling with Data: Created a video presentation to communicate insights effectively, bridging the gap between analysis and decision-making.
